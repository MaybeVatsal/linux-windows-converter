- **Preserved arguments** handling for accurate translation
- **Internal command support** for Linux-specific operations

### üõ†Ô∏è Comprehensive Categories
- **Filesystem Operations**: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`
- **File Management**: `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`
- **Process Control**: `ps`, `kill`, `top`, `bg`, `fg`
- **Network Tools**: `ping`, `ifconfig`, `netstat`, `ssh`, `wget`
- **System Info**: `whoami`, `uname`, `date`, `uptime`
- **User Management**: `sudo`, `su`, `passwd`, `useradd`
- **Package Management**: `apt`, `yum`, `pip`, `npm`

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Windows 7/8/10/11

### Installation & Usage

#### Method 1: One-Click Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Download and run setup.bat
setup.bat
```

#### Method 2: Manual Execution
```bash
# Clone or download the project
git clone https://github.com/Karan-CyberExpert/linux-windows-converter.git
cd linux-windows-converter

# Run directly
python main.py
```

#### Method 3: PIP Installation (Coming Soon)
```bash
pip install linux-win-converter
linux-converter
```

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Basic File Operations
```bash
# Linux command (automatically converted to Windows equivalent)
$ ls -la
# Executes: cmd /c dir /a

$ grep "error" logfile.txt
# Executes: findstr "error" logfile.txt

$ ps aux
# Executes: tasklist /v
```

### System Administration
```bash
# Privilege elevation
$ sudo service restart apache
# Prompts for admin rights and executes elevated command

$ su administrator
# Switch to administrator mode

# System monitoring
$ top
# Executes: tasklist with real-time updating
```

### Mixed Environment Usage
```bash
# Run native Windows commands when needed
$ win systeminfo
# Executes native Windows systeminfo command

# Combine Linux and Windows workflows
$ ls | grep .py | win more
# Linux-style piping with Windows command
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Customizing Command Mappings
Edit `main.py` to modify command translations:

```python
command_mapping = {
    "filesystem": {
        "ls": {"cmd": ["cmd", "/c", "dir"], "help": "List directory contents", "preserve_args": True},
        # Add your custom mappings here
    }
}
```

### Environment Variables
The tool automatically detects and uses your system PATH, with enhanced Windows System32 directory inclusion.

## üé® Shell Features

### Intelligent Prompt
```
[C:\Users\Karan\Projects]$  # Standard user
[C:\Windows\System32]#     # Administrator mode
```

### Special Commands
- `help` - Display comprehensive command list
- `exit`/`quit` - Exit the converter
- `win <command>` - Execute native Windows command
- `path` - Show current system PATH
- `clear` - Clear the screen

### The Solution
This converter provides:
- **Muscle memory preservation** - Use the commands you already know
- **Productivity boost** - No more constant Google searches
- **Seamless workflow** - Consistent experience across platforms
- **Learning tool** - See Windows equivalents for educational purposes

## üöß Roadmap

### Upcoming Features
- [ ] **Plugin system** for custom command extensions
- [ ] **Command history** with search functionality
- [ ] **Tab completion** for Linux commands
- [ ] **Profile system** for personalized mappings
- [ ] **GUI version** with command suggestion panel
- [ ] **Cross-platform** support for macOS bridging
- [ ] **Package manager** for easy updates

### Version Planning
- **v1.1**: Enhanced network commands and SSH support
- **v1.2**: Plugin architecture and community contributions
- **v2.0**: Graphical interface and advanced customization
